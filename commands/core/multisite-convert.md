# wp core multisite-convert

Transforms an existing single-site installation into a multisite installation.

Creates the multisite database tables, and adds the multisite constants to wp-config.php.

For those using WordPress with Apache, remember to update the `.htaccess` file with the appropriate multisite rewrite rules.

[Review the multisite documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/create-a-network/) for more details about how multisite works.

### OPTIONS

[\--title=&lt;network-title&gt;]
: The title of the new network.

[\--base=&lt;url-path&gt;]
: Base path after the domain name that each site url will start with.
\---
default: /
\---

[\--subdomains]
: If passed, the network will use subdomains, instead of subdirectories. Doesn't work with 'localhost'.

[\--skip-config]
: Don't add multisite constants to wp-config.php.

### EXAMPLES

    $ wp core multisite-convert
    Set up multisite database tables.
    Added multisite constants to wp-config.php.
    Success: Network installed. Don't forget to set up rewrite rules.
