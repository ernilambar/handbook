# wp package install

Installs a WP-CLI package.

Packages are required to be a valid Composer package, and can be specified as:

* Package name from WP-CLI's package index.
* Git URL accessible by the current shell user.
* Path to a directory on the local machine.
* Local or remote .zip file.

Packages are installed to `~/.wp-cli/packages/` by default. Use the `WP_CLI_PACKAGES_DIR` environment variable to provide a custom path.

When installing a local directory, WP-CLI simply registers a reference to the directory. If you move or delete the directory, WP-CLI's reference breaks.

When installing a .zip file, WP-CLI extracts the package to `~/.wp-cli/packages/local/&lt;package-name&gt;`.

If Github token authorization is required, a GitHub Personal Access Token (https://github.com/settings/tokens) can be used. The following command will add a GitHub Personal Access Token to Composer's global configuration:
composer config -g github-oauth.github.com &lt;GITHUB_TOKEN&gt; Once this has been added, the value used for &lt;GITHUB_TOKEN&gt; will be used for future authorization requests.

### OPTIONS

&lt;name|git|path|zip&gt;
: Name, git URL, directory path, or .zip file for the package to install. Names can optionally include a version constraint (e.g. wp-cli/server-command:@stable).

[\--insecure]
: Retry downloads without certificate validation if TLS handshake fails. Note: This makes the request vulnerable to a MITM attack.
