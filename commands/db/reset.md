# wp db reset

Removes all tables from the database.

This command runs on the `after_wp_config_load` hook, after wp-config.php has been loaded into scope.

Runs `DROP_DATABASE` and `CREATE_DATABASE` SQL statements using `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` database credentials specified in wp-config.php.

### OPTIONS
