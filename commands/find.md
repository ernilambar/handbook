# wp find

Find WordPress installations on the filesystem.

This command runs on the `before_wp_load` hook, just before the WP load process begins.

Recursively iterates subdirectories of provided &lt;path&gt; to find and report WordPress installations. A WordPress installation is a wp-includes directory with a version.php file.

Avoids recursing some known paths (e.g. /node_modules/, hidden sys dirs) to significantly improve performance.

Indicates depth at which the WordPress installations was found, and its alias, if it has one.
